<h2>About</h2>

<p>I was born in Philadelphia and have lived mostly in the South Jersey area my entire life.
  I graduated from Rutgers University with a degree in Economics in 2008, when I
  also married my college sweetheart, Rachel. We now have four children and live in Haddon Township, NJ.
</p>

<p>I've worked at Trader Joe's, a foreclosure law firm, a bankruptcy publishing company,
  and drove for UPS during peak season 2017. I've since unearthed my love for web development, and
  am looking forward to completing the NYCDA program this May 2018.</p>
